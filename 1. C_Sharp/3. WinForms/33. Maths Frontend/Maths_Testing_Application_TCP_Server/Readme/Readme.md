This is the server program for the maths testing application.

The server allows remote monitoring of the test progress as well as commands.

The server sends/receives live data to the maths testing client applications.

* this data consists of:

    * pause test command
    * resume test command
    * restart test command
    * change language test command
    * view graph of current test scores, time left, language used, amount of correct/wrong answers etc.

The server will store this data and compile graphs and spreadsheets of the results once the testing has completed.
