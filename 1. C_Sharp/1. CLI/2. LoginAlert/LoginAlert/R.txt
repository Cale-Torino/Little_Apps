Authentication shows whether an RDP user has been successfully authenticated on the server or not. 
The log is located in “Windows -> Security”. 
So you may be interested in the events with the EventID 4624 (An account was successfully logged on) or 4625 (An account failed to log on). 
Please, pay attention to the LogonType value in the event description. 
If the Remote Desktop service has been use to create new session during log on, LogonType = 10. 
If the LogonType = 7, it means that a user has reconnected to the existing RDP session.
