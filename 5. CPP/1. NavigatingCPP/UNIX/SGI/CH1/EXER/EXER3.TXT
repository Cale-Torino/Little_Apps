Although the platypus lays eggs, it is not a reptile.  
The platypus is a mammal (it feeds its young with milk from mammary glands,
it is warm-blooded, it has a four-chambered heart,
and it is covered with fur or hair on some or most of the body).
Therefore, class Platypus should derive (directly or indirectly) 
from class Mammal.
Note that multiple inheritance is not appropriate here, since
class Platypus should not derive from class Reptile.

Only two species of mammals lay eggs: the platypus and the spiny anteater.
This suggests a classification under Mammal 
of Egg_Laying and NonEgg_Laying mammal types.
Scientists created the order Monotremata (egg-laying mammals) 
to classify these two animals.
