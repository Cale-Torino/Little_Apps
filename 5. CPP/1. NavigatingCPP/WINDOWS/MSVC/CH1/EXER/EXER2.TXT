A phoneme is a meaningful sound.  
It may be spelled differently in different words or contexts.
To form a plural noun in English, add the suffix phoneme 's'.

Examples:

   boy        boys
   girl       girls
   monkey     monkeys
   computer   computers
   plant      plants
   pony       ponies  (not an exception, just a spelling change)

If the noun has an ending 's-like' sound, add the suffix phoneme 'es'.
These are not exceptions. Note that for some words, you must add 'es' while
other words just add 's' because the final silent 'e' is already there.

   bunch      bunches
   branch     branches
   space      spaces
   horse      horses
   pass       passes
   class      classes

Exceptions include the following examples.

   child      children
   man        men
   woman      women
   sheep      sheep
   octopus    octopi (octopuses is also acceptable)
