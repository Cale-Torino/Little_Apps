Airline Reservation System

*   Description

   -   1 or more Airports service a City.
   -   An Airport has departing and arriving Flights.
   -   A Flight has an Airport of origin and destination, a date, and a 
       flight number.
   -   A Flight requires a Plane.
   -   A Plane consists of multiple Seats.
   -   For each Flight, a Passenger can occupy a Seat on the Plane.
   -   Different Planes have different Seat configurations.
   -   A Travel Group consists of 1 or more Passengers, all traveling 
       together using the same Itinerary.
   -   An Itinerary consists of multiple Flights.

*   Create the Object Model

   -  Find candidate classes.
      Candidate classes include Airport, City, Flight, Airplane, 
      Seat, Passenger, TravelGroup, and Itinerary.

   -  Find associations.
      In lieu of a diagram, we describe the associations using the format:

      Class1 (attributes) Association_Name (attributes) Class2
         where Class1 and Class2 form an association labeled Association_Name
         (attributes) include multiplicity, such as many, ordered, or role names


      1.  Airport (many) Services a City.
      2.  Flight (many, ordered) Arrives at Airport 
         (role: destination) with association attribute Time.
      3.  Flight (many, ordered) Departs from Airport
         (role: origin) with association attribute Time.
      4.  An Itinerary Consists_Of (many, ordered) Flights.
      5.  An Airplane Is_Used_For (many, ordered) Flights.
      6.  Passenger, Flight, and Seat participate in a three-way 
          association as follows:
            A Passenger Occupies a Seat Associated_With a Flight.
            A Seat (optional) Is_Occupied by a Passenger during a 
            particular Flight.
      7.    An Airplane Consists_Of (many) Seats.
      8.  A TravelGroup Consists_Of (many) Passengers.
      9.  A TravelGroup Follows an Itinerary.

   -  Find class attributes and operations.
      We list some of the obvious attributes and operations.

         Airport: name:String
         City: name:String
         Flight: date:Date, Flight_Num:integer
         Plane: model_number:integer, capacity:integer
         Seat: location(row and seat_letter)
         Passenger: name:String  (lastname:String, firstname:String)
         TravelGroup: party_size:integer
         Itinerary
