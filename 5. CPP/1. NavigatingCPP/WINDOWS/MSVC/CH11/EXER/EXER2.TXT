Public derivation implements subtyping in C++.
A publicly derived class may access the public and protected members of 
its base.
A user of a publicly derived class may access the public members of the base
transparently. This transparency provides the subtyping and implements the IS-A
relationship (a derived object IS-A base).

Public derivation implements generalization and polymorphism.

Private derivation is similar to containment.
A privately derived class may access the public and protected members of its
private base. Since all base members map to the private section of the
derived class, a user of the derived class may not access any base 
class members.

Protected derivation is also similar to containment.
A derived class with protected derivation may access the public and protected
members of its protected base. Since all protected and public base members
map to the protected section of the derived class, a user of the derived
class may not access any base class members. However, any subsequently
derived class may access the public and protected members of its direct
base and any base up the inheritance tree.
