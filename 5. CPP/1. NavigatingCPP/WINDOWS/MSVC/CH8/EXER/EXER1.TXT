1. Why is it not important to implement memory pools for Arrays of 
   class objects?

   a. When you allocate arrays of class objects, you are automatically 
      pooling, since allocated free store memory must be contiguous. 

   b. Memory pooling arrays of class objects would duplicate much of 
      the code that is already provided by the free store manager.
