Code from the Book

Here is the directory structure of this CD-ROM.

                    Windows                     UNIX
                      /\                         /
                     /  \                       /
                   BCC  MSVC                  SGI
  (Borland C++ 5.01   (Microsoft C++ 5.0        (SiliconGraphics C++ 7.01
      or higher)           or higher)                    or higher)


The organization underneath each one of these subdirectories is as follows:

             (Chapters 1-14)              (Appendix)
                   CHN                       APPX    
                   /\                         /\
                  /  \                       /  \
                PGMS EXER                  IOS  STL
          (Programs) (Exercises)    (IOstream)  (Standard Template Library)

There is a makefile in each program and exercise directory that compiles 
the programs.  Use Borland's make with the BCC files and Microsoft's 
nmake with the MSVC files.  The makefiles in the SGI directories contain
SiliconGraphics options but can be modified to work with other UNIX 
C++ compilers as needed.

With Windows 95, you can use Windows Explorer to copy specific files 
or entire subtrees to any drive on your system. If you do, remember 
that Windows Explorer marks each file on the CD_ROM as read-only, 
so you'll have to change this attribute to modify your copied files.
To deselect the read-only attribute, right-click on the files in Explorer, 
choose Properties, and click the Read-Only check box.

    any copy to you.

3.  Copy Restrictions

    This Software and the accompanying printed material (the "Documentation")
    are the subject of copyright.  You may not copy the Software, except 
    that you may make a single copy of the Software for backup or archival

    or copyright infringement which is caused or encouraged by your failure 
    to abide by the terms of this restriction.

4.  Use Restrictions

    You may not network the Software or otherwise use it on more than one
    computer or computer terminal at the same time.  You may physically
    transfer the Software from one computer to another provided that the
    Software is used only one computer at a time.  You may not distribute
    copies of the Software or Documentation to others.  You may not reverse 
    engineer, disassemble, modify, adapt, translate, or create derivative 
    works base on the Software without the prior written consent of the 
    Company and the Authors of the Software.

5.  Transfer Restrictions

    The enclosed Software is licensed only to you and may not be transferred
    to anyone else without the prior written consent of the Company and
    the Authors of the Software.  Any unauthorized transfer of the Software 
    shall result in the immediate termination of this Agreement.

6.  Termination

    This license is effective until terminated.  This license will
    terminate automatically without notice from the Company and become
    null and void if you fail to comply with any provisions or limitations
    of this license.  Upon termination, you shall destroy the
    Documentation and all copies of the Software.  All provisions of this 
    Agreement as to warranties, limitation of liability, remedies or 
    damages, and our ownership rights shall survive termination.

7.  Miscellaneous

    This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of
    the United States of America and the State of New York and shall
    benefit the Company, its affiliates, assignees, and the Authors of
    the Software.

8.  Limited Warranty

    For thirty (30) days from the date of purchase, the Company warrants 
    that the media (CD-ROM) containing the Software will be free from 
    defects in materials and workmanship under normal use.

9.  Disclaimer of Further Warranties

    The Company and Authors of the Software do not warrant that the 
    Software will meet your requirements or that the operation of the 
    Software will be uninterrupted or error-free.  Your only remedy and 
    the Company's only obligation under these limited warranties is, 
    at the Company's option, return of the warranted time for a refund 
    of any amounts paid by you or replacement of the item.  Any replacement 
    of the Software or media under the warranties shall not extend the 
    original warranty period.  The limited warranty set forth above shall 
    not apply to any Software which the Company determines in good faith 
    has been subject to misuse, neglect, improper installation, repair, 
    alteration, or damage by you.

    Except for the expressed warranties set forth above, the Company
    and the Authors of the Software disclaim all warranties, express 
    or implied, including without limitation, the implied warranties 
    of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, except for 
    the express warranty set forth above, the Company does not warrant, 
    guarantee, or make any representation regarding the use of the results 
    of the use of the Software in terms of its correctness, accuracy, 
    reliability, currentness, or otherwise.

    In no event, shall the Company and the Authors of the Software or 
    its employees, agents, suppliers, or contractors be liable for any 
    incidental, indirect, special, or consequential damages arising out 
    of or in connection with the license granted under this Agreement, 
    or for loss of use, loss of data, loss of income or profit, or other 
    losses, sustained as a result of injury to any person, or loss of or 
    damage to property, or claims of third parties, even if the Company 
    or an authorized representative of the Company has been advised of 
    the possibility of such damages.  In no event shall liability of the 
    Company for damages with respect to the Software exceed the amounts 
    actually paid by you, if any, for the Software.

    Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation of implied warranties
    or liability for incidental, indirect, special, or consequential
    damages, so the above limitations may not always apply.  The warranties
    in this Agreement give you specific legal rights and you may also have
    other rights which vary in accordance with local law.

10. Acknowledgment

    You acknowledge that you have read this Agreement, understand it, and
    agree to be bound by its terms and conditions.  You also agree that 
    this Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the
    Agreement between you and the Company and supersedes all proposals or
    prior Agreements, oral, or written, any any other communications
    between you and the Company or any representative of the Company
    relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.
